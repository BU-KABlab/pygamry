First, download or clone the repository to your machine.

Anaconda/Conda users:
Do NOT install with pip (pip and conda don't mix). I would strongly recommend creating a clean conda environment configured to install all packages from the conda-forge channel (see instructions at bottom). Then:
1. Launch Anaconda Prompt and activate the environment in which you want to install the package.
2. Install required packages:
	conda install numpy pandas matplotlib comtypes
2. Navigate to the top-level pygamry directory that contains the setup.py file.
3. Run the following command to install the package in development mode:
	conda develop .

Pip users:
1. Launch Command Prompt and navigate to the top-level pygamry directory that contains the setup.py file.
2. Run the following command to install the package:
pip install .


Creating a conda environment configured for conda-forge channel
1. Create new environment (change <name> to desired environment name):
	conda create -n <name> -c conda-forge python=3.9
2. Activate the new environment:
	conda activate <name>
3. Add conda-forge channel:
	conda config --add channels conda-forge
4. Set channel priority to strict:
	conda config --set channel_priority strict
5. Install packages
