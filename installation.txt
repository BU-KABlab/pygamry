First, download or clone the pygamry repository to your machine.

Anaconda/Conda users:
1. Launch Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac).
2. Create a new conda environment from the provided configuration file:
	conda env create -f gamry.yml.
3. Activate the new environment:
	conda activate gamry
4. Install pygamry in development mode. Navigate to the top-level pygamry directory that containts the setup.py file, then install it with with:
	conda develop .

Troubleshooting note: it seems that "conda develop ." does not always work. If you find that you cannot import hybrid-drt when running the tutorial (ModuleNotFoundError), you can repeat step 4 above using "pip install ." instead of "conda develop .".

Pip users:
1. Launch Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac).
2. Next, install pygamry and all dependecies: navigate to the top-level pygamry directory that contains the setup.py file, then run the following command to install the package:
	pip install .
